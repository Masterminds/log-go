# Contributing Guide

We are happy you are interested in contributing. Before contributing, there
are some things you should know.

1. If you are creating a new implementation please consider putting that in its
   own repository. We are happy to link to that from this repository.
2. This repository follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). All public
   APIs (e.g. function names and arguments) can't change without incrementing
   the major version. Something that will be rare, if ever.
3. If you want to make some major changes to the reference implementations
   consider making another implementation in a separate repository. It's ok. Let
   us know and we'll provide a link to it in the README.

## Pull Requests

All changes to this repository happen through pull requests on GitHub. If you
have a proposed change it will need to be in the form of a pull request.

When creating the pull request please provide a use case and justification for
the change if it is for another more than a minor change. Changes to the
functionality need a good justification.

## Develoers Certificate of Origin

All changes to this repository need sign-off for the [Developers Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
You can read it below. After that are some details on how to sign you work.

Note, if you created a pull request and missed signing a commit CI will catch it
and provide directions on how correct the issue.

    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@example.com>

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically
with `git commit -s`.

Note: If your git config information is set properly then viewing the `git log` information for your
 commit will look something like this:

```
Author: Joe Smith <joe.smith@example.com>

    Update README

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@example.com>
```

Notice the `Author` and `Signed-off-by` lines match. If they don't your PR will be rejected by the
automated DCO check.
